<h1>What is Composting ?</h1>
<p>Composting is nature's process of recycling decomposed organic materials into a rich soil known as compost. <br>Anything that was once living will decompose. 
Basically, backyard composting is an acceleration of the same process nature uses. 
<br>By composting your organic waste you are returning nutrients back into the soil in order for the cycle of life to continue. </p>
<h1>Benefits</h1>
<p>
   <br> 1. Yard and food waste make up 30% of the waste stream. Composting your kitchen and yard trimmings helps divert that waste from the landfill, waterways and water treatment facilities.
    <br>2. You will significantly reduce pest problems–and your use of pesticides.
   <br> 3. Healthy plants from healthy soil look better, produce better and have a much greater ability to fight off pests and diseases.
    <br>4. Adding organic materials to the soil improves moisture retention.
    <br>5. Adding decomposed organic material to the soil feeds beneficial organisms.
    <br>6. Compost amends both sandy and clay soils.
    <br>7. Compost provides a balanced, slow–release source of nutrients that helps the soil hold nutrients long enough for plants to use them.
    <br>8. Composting saves money–you avoid the cost of buying soil conditioners, bagged manure etc.
    <br>9. Feeding your plants well will improve your own diet. Plants grown in depleted soils have a reduced nutrient content.
    <br>10. Home composting is a valuable tool in educating children about nature and the cycle of life.
